xlsKonverter
============

Simple converter from a defined XLSX to specially formatted HTML. Uses Java 8 lambdas and JavaFX.

This was a favor to my Hamburg chess club, which uses this software in preparing the invitations to the annual club championship tournament.

Uses Apache POI for processing the xlsx file and Jsoup for the HTML part.
